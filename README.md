# Iris_Classification-  
Using data science methodology to classified iris flowers  

step 1 `Defining problem` == `distinguished between iris flower species based on their features`  
step 2 `Import dataset` from `https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/`  
step 3 `Wrangling and Pre-proccessing`  
step 4 `EDA`  
step 5 `Feature Engineering and Statistics correlations`  
step 6 `Appling machine learning algorithms`   
step 7 `Prepare suitable approach for clustering algorithm` coming soon... :smiley:
